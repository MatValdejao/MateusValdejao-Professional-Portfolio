## Purpose
The purpose of this website is to provide potential employers with a snapshot into my professional accomplishments and developments. The website provides some insight into who I am as a person as well as an employee. 

Furthermore, the website gives a snapshot of past and current (in development) projects so that prospective employers can gain a sneakpeek into the quality of my work. Finally, the website provides links to my Resume in the header, as well as links to some of my professional websites such as LinkedIn and GitHub.
